DEPENDENCIES

Shield needs GNU make or a workalike.

Shield uses the Oracle OCCI library to connect to the oracle
server. To obtain the headers and libraries needed to use OCCI,
download the oracle instant client software. This software can be
obtained free of charge at oracle.com.


COMPILING SHIELD

At the writing of this document, OCCI was still only distributed in
binary form, compiled against an older version of the c++ standard
library. Unfortunatly, all pieces of a program need to be compiled
against the same library version. Because the standard library version
is directly dependant on the compiler version, shield must be compiled
using an older compiler. Under RHEL4, such a compiler can be installed
by executing the following command as root:

yum install compat-gcc-32-c++

In order to use this compiler, run the following command before configuring shield:

CXX=g++32

The main shield parser is roughly 20000 lines long, which is a pretty heavy burden for a C++ compiler. Unless you have huge amounts of memory (at least 2 GB) you will need to disable any optimization flags enabled by configure. This can be done by running the following command before configuring shield:

CXXFLAGS=-g

Other than these issues, compiling shield should be a simple case of

./configure && make && make install
